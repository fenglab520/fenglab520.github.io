Our collaborative work on the development and validation of a new genome-wide association method is now out in Nature Genetics

We collaborated with scholars from the University of Queensland, Australia, to validate and apply their novel genome-wide association study (GWAS) method in three East Asian biobanks (including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). This method corrects for polygenic scores of other chromosomes (leave-one-out PGS) when performing GWAS on each chromosome. Additionally, it proposes a 2-step meta-analysis, using the PGS generated from the first meta-analysis as a covariate in the second meta-analysis. This effectively reduces background variation in the model, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and statistical power. In real data analysis, this method identified more genetic loci significantly associated with human traits and important biomarkers (such as height, BMI, HDL, and cholesterol), and improved the performance of polygenic score predictions, particularly for non-European populations with smaller sample sizes.
