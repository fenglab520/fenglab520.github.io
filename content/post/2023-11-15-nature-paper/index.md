Our collaborative work on the development and validation of a new genome-wide association method is now out in *Nature Genetics*
<!--more-->

We collaborated with University of Queensland scholars to validate and apply their novel genome-wide association study (GWAS) method in three East Asian biobanks (including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). This approach corrects for polygenic scores of other chromosomes and uses a 2-step meta-analysis to reduce background variation and enhance statistical power. It identified more genetic loci associated with key traits and biomarkers (such as height and HDL) and improved polygenic predictions, especially for smaller non-European populations.
