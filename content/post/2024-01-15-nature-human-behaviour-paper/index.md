Our collaborative study on the cross-population genetic architecture of education attainment is published in *Nature Human Behaviour*
<!--more-->
This joint study by Taiwan and South Korea researchers presents the first large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment, a heritable trait linked to cognitive ability, in East Asian ancestry. Combining this with data from European ancestry, the study reveals a high genetic correlation and similar functional enrichment between populations. Cross-ancestry analysis improved variant fine-mapping and polygenic prediction transferability. The research supports the importance of diverse ancestries to better understand the genetics of educational attainment.
